Abstract
This project explores the implementation of a novel algorithm for the detection of antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) using the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano platform, a compact computing system
ideal for point-of-care diagnostics. Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to global
health by reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics, making the rapid and accurate detection of
AMR critical for appropriate treatment decisions.
Leveragingadvancedmachinelearningtechniquesandgenomicdataanalysis,thisprojectadapts
an existing algorithm, previously developed and available on GitHub, for deployment on an
embedded system. The primary objectives included optimizing and testing the algorithm on
the Jetson Orin Nano to ensure high accuracy and speed, crucial for real-time applications.
Various machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector
Machine, and Convolutional Neural Network were evaluated for their performance in AMR
prediction. The results demonstrated that these models could effectively process and predict
AMR from genomic data, with Random Forest showing the highest overall performance.
The project not only proved the technical feasibility of the system but also highlighted its

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents one of the most pressing health challenges of our
time, posing a significant threat to the effectiveness of antibiotics which are crucial for treating
bacterial infections. The ability to rapidly and accurately detect AMR can greatly enhance
medical outcomes by guiding appropriate antibiotic usage, thus preserving their effectiveness
and preventing further resistance spread. With the advent of advanced computing platforms
and machine learning technologies, there is an unprecedented opportunity to leverage these
tools in the fight against AMR.
This project focuses on the application of a cutting-edge algorithm, previously developed and
available on GitHub and described in scientific literature, for the detection of antimicrobial
resistance. Thealgorithmemploysgenomicdatatopredictresistance,utilizingmachinelearning

Background and Literature Review
The problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is not only a pivotal health issue but also
an evolving challenge in medical science and technology. The ability to detect AMR swiftly
and accurately is crucial, as it directly influences treatment decisions and outcomes. Tradi-
tional methods for detecting AMR typically involve culture-based techniques, which can be
time-consuming and may not always provide the rapid responses required in clinical settings.
In response, recent advancements have focused on genomic and computational approaches to
predict AMR, offering the potential for faster, and often more precise, diagnostics.
2.1 Previous Work in AMR Detection
Several methods have been developed to detect AMR, each with its advantages and limitations:
2.1.1 Phenotypic Testing
The traditional gold standard for AMR detection involves culturing bacteria and testing their
growth responses to antibiotics. This method is reliable but typically requires 24-48 hours to
yield results, which can be detrimental in urgent care scenarios.
2.1.2 Molecular Diagnostics
Techniques such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and real-time PCR have been employed
todetectspecificresistancegenes. Thesemethodsarefasterthanphenotypictestingbutrequire
prior knowledge of the resistance mechanisms involved.
2.1.3 Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
WGS offers comprehensive insights into the genetic material of pathogens, allowing for the
detection of all known and novel resistance genes. However, the analysis and interpretation of
WGS data demand significant computational resources and expertise.

2.2 Genomic Approaches and Machine Learning
The use of genomic data combined with machine learning methods has emerged as a powerful
approach to predict AMR. This strategy involves several steps, each critical for ensuring the
accuracy and efficacy of the predictions:
1. Data Acquisition: Genomic data is acquired, typically through sequencing, and involves
collecting and preprocessing information to make it suitable for analysis.
2. VariantCalling: Usingtoolslikebcftools,geneticvariantsareidentifiedagainstareference
genome, suchasEscherichiacoliK-12strainMG1655. Thisprocesshelpspinpointgenetic
differences that may confer resistance.
3. SNP-matrix Construction: Identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are used
to construct an SNP-matrix, representing the genomic landscape of the bacteria. This
matrix is crucial for subsequent analysis.
4. Data Encoding: SNP data is encoded using methods like label encoding and one-hot
encoding to transform qualitative genetic information into a quantitative format that is
amenable to machine learning algorithms.
2.3 Novelty of the Current Approach
This project builds upon these existing methods by implementing an AMR detection algorithm
on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, a compact yet powerful computing platform suitable for
point-of-care settings. By adapting the algorithm for use on an embedded system, this project
aims to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting rapid, on-site AMR diagnostics, which could
significantlyimpactclinicaldecision-makingandpatientoutcomes. Thecombinationofgenomic
data analysis with advanced machine learning models and edge computing represents a novel
and potentially transformative approach to combating the global challenge of antimicrobial
resistance.

Technical Descriptions
3.1 Data Preprocessing for AMR Prediction Using FCGR
3.1.1 Understanding FCGR (Frequency Chaos Game Representation)
Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) is a bioinformatics technique that transforms
DNA sequences into a two-dimensional representation. Each nucleotide base (A, C, G, T) is
assigned to a quadrant in a square, allowing the sequence to be plotted as a continuous path
withinthissquare. ThismethodcondensescomplexDNAsequencesintoacompactformatthat
retains essential information, making it particularly useful for machine learning applications
where patterns in the data need to be clearly identified and analyzed.
3.1.2 Rationale for Using FCGR
The genomic sequences associated with AMR contain complex patterns that could indicate
resistance traits. FCGR converts these patterns into numerical matrices that machine learning
algorithms can more easily process. The goal is to extract features that significantly enhance
the ability to predict AMR from genomic data effectively.
In the preprocessing workflow for AMR prediction using FCGR, several essential steps are
undertaken to prepare the genomic data for analysis. Initially, necessary libraries such as
data.tableforefficientdatamanipulationandkaosforperformingFCGRongeneticsequences
are loaded. The genomic data, stored in “example data.csv,” is then loaded using the fread
functionfromdata.tableanddecodedbackintonucleotidecharacters(’N’,’A’,’G’,’C’,’T’)for
further processing. Subsequently, the data is transposed to align the sequences correctly for the
FCGRprocess. Aftertransposition,thedataisconvertedintocharactervectors,preparingitfor
theencodingprocess. Finally,eachsequenceisprocessedindividuallytocreateanFCGRmatrix

for transforming genomic sequences into a format suitable for subsequent machine learning
models, leveraging a novel approach to capture the essence of the genomic data effectively.
This streamlined approach ensures that genomic sequences are accurately and efficiently con-
verted into a format suitable for advanced machine learning analysis.

Hardware Implementation Overview
During my B.Tech project, I focused on implementing and configuring the NVIDIA Jetson
Orin Nano for our antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection system. The initial setup required
installingtheoperatingsystemandnecessarylibraries, whichIcompletedusingNVIDIA’sSDK
Manager to install JetPack components. This setup proved complex, particularly for someone
setting it up for the first time. I faced several challenges, such as issues with flashing the Jetson
with a new operating system and booting from an SSD, often caused by incorrect bootloader
settings or SSD compatibility issues.
Once the hardware was ready, I began testing various machine learning models, including Ran-
domForest(RF),SupportVectorMachine(SVM),LogisticRegression(LR),andConvolutional
Neural Network (CNN). My goal was to evaluate the Jetson Orin Nano’s capability to handle
the complex computational tasks these models demand. This involved ensuring that the system
could efficiently run the necessary software and models for effective AMR detection.
Looking ahead, I plan to develop a user-friendly external display, likely using an OLED device,
to show the prediction results clearly. This will allow clinicians to easily determine the presence
of AMR in patients, enhancing the practical utility of our system in clinical settings.
