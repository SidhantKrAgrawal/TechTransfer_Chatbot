I. INTRODUCTION
Analog ICs and SOCsrequire clock signalgeneratorsthat arebothenergy-efficientand compact.
While quartz crystals, RC, or LC components are commonly used in oscillator circuits,they are
not optimal for on-chip applications. The Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) can be realized
using either a ring oscillator or an LC resonator within the CMOS process. While the LC
resonator offers improved noise characteristics and higher operating frequencies, it occupies
more layout area due to the on-chip spiral inductor and has a limited tuning range. Conversely,
the ring oscillator design eliminates the need for inductance and can achieve a broad tuning
range,though attheexpenseof poorernoise performance andlower operatingfrequencies.
The Ring Oscillator (RO) is well-suited for on-chip applications because of its simple design,
low cost, and expanded functionality. Additionally, ROs have a wide tuning range.CMOSRing
Oscillators are an excellent alternative for energy-efficient applications due to their low power
consumption. A Ring Oscillator (RO) circuit istypically built byinterconnectinganoddnumber
of inverter cells. These inverters form a sequential chain in which the output of the last step is
fed back to the first stage. Phase noise, consumption of power,frequency tuningrange,andchip
space are all key concerns in RO design. Ring Oscillators are used to benchmark new Process
Design Kits (PDK) for performance and power, providing valuable insights into the capabilities
of new technologies. Their simple design and implementation make ring oscillators a
budget-friendly yethighly functional choice.
A PVT insensitive ring oscillator is designed to operate over a range of process variations,
supply voltage fluctuations and temperature changes. We can use this type of ring oscillator in
integrated circuit design to ensure that thecircuit works correctlyevenif environmentalchanges
and manufacturing changes happen. In order to preserve frequency stability, a PVT-insensitive
ring oscillator ismade tobe lesssensitive totheseprocessfluctuations. Reducingdesign margins
when creating a PVT-insensitive ring oscillator can result in higher performance, moreeffective
resource management, and lower power usage. By guaranteeing that a higher proportion of
manufactured circuits fulfill the specified performance standards, a PVT-insensitive design can
improve chip yield, leading to higher production yields and more dependable goods. Ring
Oscillator provides precise timing for digital circuits, ensuring synchronization across
components. They are also used as Voltage-Controlled Oscillators in PLLs, ring oscillators help
in frequency synchronization, vital for communication systems. Through Built-in Self-Test
(BIST), they help in measuring performance and detecting faults, ensuring reliability. By
observing frequency changes, ring oscillators enable temperature monitoring, and their use in
power management circuitsoptimizes distribution. Their inherentinstabilitycan beharnessed for
cryptographic applications, enhancing security. In time-based ADCs, ring oscillators bridge the
gap between analog signals and digital interpretation. As Local Oscillators in RF Circuits, they
playa keyrolein frequencysynthesis for wirelesstechnology.

II. DIFFERENT TOPOLOGIES OF RING OSCILLATORS
A. Basic Ring Oscillator
Fig. 1.Design ofBasic RingOscillator
The basic Ring Oscillator (RO) is built by joining inverter cells in a cascade arrangement. To
attain the specified oscillation frequency range, a five-stage design is used. The Barkhausen
conditions, which require unity voltage gain and a phase shift of 2π, must be met by the RO
circuit to assure persistent oscillations. The feedback network provides a phase shift of π, while
the extra phase shift of π is accomplished by connecting the stages of the RO circuit. This
permits the oscillating signal to travelthrough each stepand achievetheremaining phase shiftin

C. Current Starved Skewed PMOS Ring Oscillator
Fig.3 Current Starved Skewed PMOS Ring Oscillator
In this circuit, the MOSFETs Mbp and Mbn serve as current sources while the MOSFETs Mip
and Min serve as an inverter. By mirroringoperation (and maintainingthe sameaspectratios for
all biasing PMOS and NMOS transistors), Mbp and Mbn generate biasing current. Low power
consumption is possible in this setup because the bias current, which is in the order of
microamperes, keeps the transistors operating in the vicinity of the sub-threshold region. The
negative delay elements are connectedtothe PMOS'sinput.Asa result,the PMOS'sinputsignal
arrives before the NMOS's. The skewed delay cell accelerates the low-to-high output transition
by turning the PMOS on early, in contrast to the standard inverter cell. Hence, the cell delay is
minimized and results in improved frequency of operation. Negativelyskewed PMOSdelay RO

combined as the operating concept. Under same operating conditions, this circuitexhibits better
power consumption in PMOS skewed as compared to NMOS skewed CS.Since NMOS is
quicker than PMOS, frequency is higher inNMOSskewed thanin PMOSskewed withthesame
inverter arrangement. In a similar vein, NMOS skewing consumes more power than PMOS

**Visual Elements:**

*   **Type:** Bar Graph
*   **Bars:** Three vertical bars colored in a dark red or brown. Each bar represents a different ring oscillator topology.
*   **Axes:**
    *   X-axis (horizontal): Labeled "Topologies," indicating the type of ring oscillator being compared. The labels beneath each bar are: "Basic," "Current Starved," and "SPMOS."
    *   Y-axis (vertical): Labeled "Frequency Variation in %," showing the percentage of frequency variation. The y-axis scale ranges from 0 to 40, with marked increments of 10.
*   **Gridlines:** Horizontal gridlines are present at intervals of 10 along the Y-axis, providing visual reference for the values.

**Text Content (From Image):**

*   "Frequency Variation in %"
*   "Topologies"
*   "Basic"
*   "Current Starved"
*   "SPMOS"
*   "40"
*   "30"
*   "20"
*   "10"
*   "0"

**Contextual Significance:**

The graph visualizes a comparison of the frequency variation of three ring oscillator topologies: Basic, Current Starved, and SPMOS (likely an abbreviation for "Skewed PMOS"). The Y-axis represents the percentage of frequency variation, which likely indicates the sensitivity of the oscillator's frequency to changes in process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) conditions. Lower percentage of variation is preferable.

Based on the bar heights, the "Basic" topology exhibits the highest frequency variation, while the "Current Starved" topology shows the least. "SPMOS" falls in between. This suggests the "Current Starved" topology is more stable and less susceptible to PVT variations compared to the "Basic" topology.

**Analysis within Document:**

From the surrounding text, this graph appears to be from a report on "Design of different topologies of Ring Oscillators for PVT Sensor application." The accompanying text describes the simulation conditions (65nm technology, 1.2V, TT corner, -40°C to 125°C) and highlights that the Current Starved Ring Oscillator and Skewed PMOS Ring Oscillator have the least frequency variation. These findings align with the graph's representation.

    *   **SS:** Slow NMOS, Slow PMOS
    *   **TT:** Typical NMOS, Typical PMOS
    *   **FF:** Fast NMOS, Fast PMOS
    *   **SF:** Slow NMOS, Fast PMOS
    *   **FS:** Fast NMOS, Slow PMOS
*   **Performance Metric:** The numbers within the table likely represent the percentage of Frequency Variations across these Process Corners with a voltage range from 1.08V to 1.32V (as mentioned in the nearby text of the image)
*   **Design Evaluation:**  The purpose of this table is to compare the performance (specifically frequency stability) of the different RO topologies under various manufacturing process variations. The goal is to identify a design that is robust and relatively insensitive to these variations. The Skewed PMOS one seems to have issues on SF corner.

**In summary:** The image is a data table showing performance characteristics of different Ring Oscillator designs under different manufacturing conditions. It's a crucial part of the research for understanding the robustness and stability of the designs.

IV. CONCLUSION
The study and analysis of various topologies of 5-stage and 7-stage ring oscillators have
provided valuable insights into their performance characteristics and trade-offs. Each topology
exhibits distinct advantages and limitations that cater to specific design requirements. The
standard 5-stage ring oscillator topology offers simplicity and ease of implementation. Its
balanced designensuressymmetricalpropagation delaysandapredictable oscillationfrequency.
However, its susceptibilityto processvariationsandtemperature effectsmight limitits frequency
stability and overall performance in demanding applications. The current starved ring oscillator
topology addressespowerconsumptionconcerns byutilizingcurrent-starved inverters,leadingto
reduced energy consumption. This makes it a favorable choice for low-power applications.
However, the trade-off is often reflected in a compromise on operational frequency and a
potential increase in delay variability.ThenegativePMOSskewed delay ringoscillator topology
optimizes performance by adjusting PMOS behavior to mitigate PMOS-NMOS speed
imbalances. This results in improved frequency of operation. Ultimately, the choice of ring
oscillator topology shouldbe guidedbyathorough understanding ofthe application’soperational
profile, power constraints, frequency requirements and tolerance for design complexity. By
leveraging the strengths of these different topologies, designers can make informed decisionsto
achieve optimalperformanceand efficiencyfor theirspecific.
